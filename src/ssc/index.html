    <h1>SSC</h1>

    <p id="ntl-button-p">
        <a id="ntl-button" href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/nichoth/ssc-server">
            <img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg">
        </a>
    </p>

    <p>
        This is your private key
        <button id="copy-priv-key">
            <img class="copy-icon" src="/ssc/copy-solid.svg" title="copy">
        </button>
        <pre id="the-private-key"></pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        It will never be shown again. Every time you refresh this page, a new
        keypair will be generated. You can copy and paste the given private key
        into the netlify form, in the "secret key" field after clicking the
        "deploy to netlify" button above.
    </p>


    <p>
        Clicking 'deploy to netlify' above will deploy your own backend to store
        photographs, and also serve as a social network.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will need to sign up for several web services in order to do this.
        You will need an account on <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>
        and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify</a> for the web hosting,
        and you will need to visit <a href="https://fauna.com/">faunaDB</a> and
        <a href="https://cloudinary.com/">cloudinary</a>, which will save the
        content for your web app. All these services have free tiers of pricing,
        so it will cost nothing and not require a credit card to start with.
    </p>

    <p>
        After you click the 'deploy' button above, it will take you to a webpage
        that asks you to input a secret key for each of those &mdash; fauna
        &amp; cloudinary. So after you have created the accounts, be sure to
        keep the pages open so you can copy and paste a secret key for each.
    </p>

    <p>
        Also during this process we create a keypair for your new server. Since
        it is important to keep your secret key <em>actually secret</em>, the
        secret key is created in your browser, and will never appear in any logs
        in netlify. It is copy and pasted as an environment variable in your
        server, so it is persistent but still secret.
    </p>

    <h2>Updates</h2>

    <p>
        So that's all well and good, but how do I update my deployed server
        with any new stuff that is made?
    </p>

    <p>
        In the terminal, first clone your own github repo, then from that
        directory, add my repo as a remote
    </p>

    <pre>git remote add upstream git@github.com:nichoth/ssc-server.git</pre>

    <p>Then you want to pull the changes from my repo &mdash;</p>

    <pre>git pull upstream main</pre>

    <p>
        and merge them into your main branch, then push that to your github
        remote.
    </p>
