        You can easily deploy your own backend to store photographs,
        and also serve as a social network.
    </p>

    <p>The first things you need to do are visit
        <a href="https://fauna.com/">faunaDB</a> and
        <a href="https://cloudinary.com/">cloudinary</a>, and
        sign up for an account with each of them. They both have free tiers of
        pricing, so it costs nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
        After you click the 'deploy' button above, it will take you to a webpage
        that asks you to input a secret key for each of those &mdash; fauna
        &amp; cloudinary. So after you have created the accounts, be sure to
        keep them open so you can copy and paste a secret key for each.
    </p>

    <p>
        Also during this process we create a keypair for your new server. Since
        it is important to keep your secret key <em>actually secret</em>, the 
        secret key is created in your browser, and will never appear in any logs
        in netlify. It is saved as an environment variable in your server, so
        it is persistent but still secret.
