## New mushroom website just dropped, as they say

the official live version is just a placeholder -- [mycomoon.com](https://mycomoon.com/)

This is the development version -- [https://chec--mycomoon.netlify.app/](chec--mycomoon.netlify.app)

My friend is starting a business that will sell medicinal mushroom products, things like lion's mane tinctures and what have you. The focus being more on medicinal, government sanctioned mushrooms vs recreational ones.

### the gritty details
The website started out using *square* as a CMS and payment processor. That was working alright, then I left it alone for a couple months, and when I opened it again nothing worked. I'm not sure if it's due to errors on square's side of things, or a method of culling inactive sites from their CDN/CMS. Anyway, I then switched it to use [commerce.js](https://commercejs.com/), which is a CMS for online stores. I don't think they are also a payment processor. I think you would use it in addition to square or stripe or something.

The key element here is the same as most of my projects -- which is that it is *free* to use these things. That's right, it costs nothing to host this website + shopping CMS. I imagine shopify would be a little bit nicer, but they have a monthly fee of like $30.

It's amazing to me how much you can do for free. It is hosted on *netlify* too, which I am a fan of.
