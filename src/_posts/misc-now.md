This is something new, for me, life under fascism. It's funny. It's not black
and white, the new regime. There are many shades if gray in between. You don't
wake up one day and all of a sudden, you're living in a fascist country.

Well, looking at history, there are certain moments. I'm thinking of
*Kristallnacht* in Germany. But this time, it feels more like a long process
of pushing the culture/policies a little at a time. Today, I felt
a change. I had a thought like, "ok. We now live in a fascist world."

We are ~12 days into it.

I'm all of a sudden very much more appreciative, grateful for my time living
in the past, in a place that was at least ostensibly anti-fascist.

It's funny, the ordinariness of it. It's like that story about the frog, who
doesn't notice that the water is starting to boil because it happens gradually.
My day to day life has not changed so much. I am very lucky to not be on the
front lines. My life or death does not totally depend on these things. If
I were in different shoes, the water would be much warmer.

They say that's part of the strategy. Everyone has to keep going to
work, keep paying bills, keep eating sandwiches. The idea is to keep us all so
distracted by survival that we are not able to notice the water is getting
warmer.

So, the question is, what do I do now? Things are just constantly getting
warmer. I wish there were a guage for it.

Early pandemic, there was a tweet (remember those?) that said something like
"Cool how we're all just emailing our way through the apocalypse." Well,
now we are emailing our way through a descent into fascism.

True to my character, I am publishing a blog post. It doesn't help
things. Maybe it gives me some clarity.

I keep thinking of the anecdote about Kurt GÃ¶del, when he was applying for
US citizenship. He had noticed a fatal flaw in the constitution, that would
allow the USA to legally become a fascist state. He was coming from Germany,
so this is something he cared about. The story goes, that a friend told him,
"keep quiet about the fascism flaw, just become a US citizen and be done with
it."
