# development diary

Working is funny lately because it definitely has not been *fun*. I have memories of working on things  just because it's fun, with no thought about it being useful or good. But i guess a part of devloping is that you *want it to be boring*. Right? that's the part that we were always working towards. When you could just do things without thinking about it too much.

Have been doing a lot of 'client work' lately. I say client work because it's mundane, but it's really just doing things for friends for free. A new version of the mushroom website -- [https://version-two--mycomoon.netlify.app/](https://version-two--mycomoon.netlify.app/) . I don't know how i feel about the new version. There's more going on in the navigation than in the previous version, so i think it could be needlessly more complex. Also a very early version of a website for cory in the death doula world -- [https://corrr.netlify.app/](https://corrr.netlify.app/) .

The good news is that i may soon actually get to work on my own project again -- https://github.com/nichoth/ssc-server .
