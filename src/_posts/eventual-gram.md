# eventual gram

[nichoth/eventual-gram/releases](https://github.com/nichoth/eventual-gram/releases)

This is an application like 'instagram', but using the SSB protocol. SSB/patchwork is a cool community of people, so naturally it seemed like a good fit for the photo project. This uses the classic `ssb` stack, and is an electron app. This is 'thick' client style, meaning that everything is downloaded and served from the computer you are using.
