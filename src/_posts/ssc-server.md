This is my solution for hosting some images... just build your own instagram. No big deal. 

`SSC` because it builds off of the ideas of `ssb`. We have taken the decentralized data model of `ssb`, but put it on a centralized server, which is helpful because you can use it with a traditional web-app, not only an electron-based 'thick' style client, which was the original model for `ssb`. 

The need to replicate all data with other clients is a bit of a hindrance with `ssb`. Here this server has the same purpose as clients in ssb. The server runs a client, then you can connect to it via the web browser, and you don't have to download more data than you want to look at.
