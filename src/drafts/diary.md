The power went out tonight. The perfect opportunity for ssb, the offline-first social network. 

As I was laying in this morning, around 5 AM (I woke up too early as usual) I thought of a metaphor for the experience of working at planetary. Lets say you are walking home one day, and the crows are doing something unusual. It's up to you to interpret that. Is it a sign, or does it mean nothing? Who can say? That's what it's like. You are shown signs, and it's up to you to interpret them. There is no judge, unfortunately. And this is how they communicate, the person rabble. You might see a hint of a sign along the way, and maybe it means nothing, or maybe it is a very serious omen. You have to make a call about that. It would be nice to be in a situation where people tell you what you should do, even in very general terms, but you don't have that luxury this time. It's more about interpreting omens.

I wrote last time about having many terrible jobs in the past. And that's true -- it's incredible the situations you will find yourself in when you know that you are making a life or death choice about working in that call center. But the exception is with "tech" related jobs. This is unusual in that regard. For the most part it's been really smooth sailing since I got started doing javascript.
