it is literally

1. hypercore-protocol (to replicate data between peers)
2. hypercore is an append only log, merkelized with a signed root
3. hyperbee, hyperdrive and others are data structures (e.g. key value store, file system, ...) that save all operations and data in hypercores "behind the scenes"
4. hyperdht/hyperswarm is a distributed hash table to discover peers based on public keys or discover peers based on topics (e.g. hashes of public keys representing hypercores)
5. hyperdht/hyperswarm have distributed hole punching built in, so peers behind firewalls can have peers in the network help them get out of or break through any firewalls to connect with other peers
i would say that is the gist
