What could be better?

Electron. We want to use a web browser to read content. That's what it is
designed for -- browsing content.

There has always been that separation of content between ssb and the larger internet, where you have to run your own "thick" client, that will download *all the data* from people you are following. 

Even though web viewers have been created for it, they are *kind of* separate from the rest of the web. For example, it is traditional to use a `robots.txt` file to tell google not to index your viewer website. And also users must opt-in to having their content shown on the web. 

Those things are ok, but it sort provides a false sense of security (or insularity). These are all things that point to the sense of "community" within the ssb world. The idea that only a small number of known people will read your content.

But what does that mean? it is a casual way of creating a garden, a
defense against the [dark forest](https://onezero.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1) that is the larger internet.

It is true that anyone in the same pub can run an ssb client and download and read the content you have posted. So your posts really are *public*, and the sense of community is more like an unintentional side effect.

But what if pubs were much easier to deploy and maintain? Like if you didn't
need to write *any code* to operate a pub. It might be much better in that
case, because the pub could be easily and actively maintained.

Ultimately you want messages to be *encrypted at rest*. And use a key that is shared amongst a group of people to decrypt them.
