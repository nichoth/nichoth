The key part of ssb is that replication is based on the *social graph*. Meaning the content that you see and gossip depends on who your friends are. 

There are equivalent parts for other things, like `ipfs` & `libp2p`. But I don't see anything else where networking is based on a social graph, and that's what we want.
