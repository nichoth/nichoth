* Started a component library -- [Things to make](https://github.com/nichoth/components/issues/1)

## refactor existing things for ESM
`esbuild` was a missing ingredient for me in my standard build tools. Now it
is fairly easy to create both ESM & CJS versions for everything. I even made
this reproducible in [nichoth/template-js](https://github.com/nichoth/template-js).

* [nichoth/routes](https://github.com/nichoth/routes) -- based on `ruta3`, but under my own namespace -- `@nichoth/routes`
* [nichoth/single-page](https://github.com/nichoth/single-page)
* [nichoth/catch-links](https://github.com/nichoth/catch-links)
* [nichoth/route-event](https://github.com/nichoth/route-event)
