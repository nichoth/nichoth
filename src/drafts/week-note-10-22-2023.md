# week note

## Sunday, Oct 22, 2023
What am I doing? That's the theme for the day.

Reading over [Matt Webb's blog](https://interconnected.org/home/), I feel suddenly worried about my place in the world. I just bought a book, *The Worst Journey in the World*. I can't remember what else I'm supposed to read. Need to read the `gwern` website, and the `interconnected` (Matt Webb) blog. I should make a written report -- unpublished -- about each.

So much planning things. It feels like all my time is spent planning for various things, and never actually doing anything... Just for the week notes, I need to build a way to publish and view them on the website. This is in addition to building a way to decrypt the envelope messages on my site.

Those things are in addition to learning about business life...

Need to make a plan. Something granular. I need a gigantic notebook. Need to start the day at a specific time. I need a routine. I should book a time in the "unoffice hours".
