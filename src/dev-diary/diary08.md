Almost done with [eventual gram](https://github.com/nichoth/eventual-gram-ssb), so that's good i suppose. Have been thinking a lot about ssb running in browsers, and I kind of realized that the only thing that makes ssb a cool radical p2p project™ is that you have all the data *on your computer*. That's what makes it independent from a *centralized* server -- there is not one place where the data is. So maybe electron is not so bad. It does what is needed — unlimited local storage with a web-based UI. 

If you go the in-browser route of using indexedDB as basically a local cache, you lose independence from servers, and you basically have something like firebase or rxdb.

Also added more photos (postcards) to [my website](http://nichoth.com/detritus/). I noticed that my plugin, [ssb-tags](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nichoth/ssb-tags), doesn't work the first time you use it, so need to figure that out.
