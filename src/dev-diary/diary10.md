## special bonus edition re: radicle

Read about [radicle](https://radicle.xyz/) today. A [nice article](https://radicle.xyz/radicle-link.html)

From the article:
> Radicle Link extends Git with peer-to-peer network discovery. Taking inspiration from Secure Scuttlebutt,

Which is ironic, because I thought peer discovery was the weak point in the ssb system. It depends heavily on pub servers, and maintains a simple list of peer (server) addresses to try to connect to. Which is not to be critical of the way ssb works, it's kind of just an insurmountable obstacle â€” peer connections over the internet.

What is radicle?

> returning to a fully distributed model

It seems that radicle uses a 'local-first' approach with issues/project metadata in addition to the source code (git files).

 Ironically I heard about radicle on twitter (the opposite of decentralized) from the person [@Kira](@C3iYh/12sO1uvKq1KcZXLFxSySzxOkHxXN8rtNB5MGA=.ed25519) I think.

-----------------------------------------------

I don't think I've done anything substantial lately. I was thinking that [eventual-gram](https://github.com/nichoth/eventual-gram-ssb) is more or less 'done' now. I need to do a couple things so it's more usable then it's time to set it free.

Also read about [gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/faq.html) and [agregore](https://github.com/AgregoreWeb/agregore-browser) browsers. It seems like people are fond of using `dat` now. I think beaker has built in dat also.
